Excolo Slider
============
A simple jquery sliding plugin, supporting responsive design, keyboard and touch navigation. 

Under development - see issues. 
(paused - work continues after June 7th 2013 - gotta concentrate on finishing my master thesis :-) )


Features:
- AutoPlay Slideshow
- Keyboard slide navigation
- Repeat when last slide is reached
- Play the slideshow backwards
- Auto adjust size initially and on browser resize, for responsive designs
- Touch enabled (limited to a few browsers)

Most of these features can be configured and turned off, when setting up the slider.
